# VIBE CODING INSTRUCTIONS
## Project: The Software Showroom - Software Purchasing Assistant Website

### PROJECT VISION
**"The Software Showroom"** - A platform that enables software buyers through their purchase end-to-end by providing them relevant resources every step of the way, including software discovery, research, comparisons, evaluation and implementation.

**Key Message**: The current software buying process is not "broken" â€“ it's "incomplete". We're bridging that gap with deeper level discovery.

### CORE PHILOSOPHY
- **Deeper Level Discovery** - we provide deeper insights than superficial, high-level data
- **NOT** claiming to revolutionize buying experience - just providing deeper insights
- **Standalone discovery platform** - users don't need to complete "Level 1" elsewhere first
- **We incorporate foundational features** (except reviews) but go much deeper
- **Unbiased towards big players** - treat all listings horizontally
- **Success derived from vendor success** - sell the listing users are on, not distract with alternatives
- **Clutter-free, focused, niche** - NO million reviews or thousands of alternatives
- **Tools at every step** - research, reports, comparisons, community, implementation support
- **Customized profiles** that mold to product requirements, not templates

### DESIGN PRINCIPLES
- **Modern, Attractive, Dynamic** - contemporary web design with relevant graphics/animations
- **Gradients preferred over solid colors** - modern color palette
- **Modest but engaging** - not cluttered or too colorful
- **Simplistic but Fancy** - eye-catching design without overdoing it
- **Hero sections** should be impactful and engaging
- **Split into sections** for easier editing later
- **Enhance UX with graphics/animations** but don't overdo it

### MESSAGING STRATEGY
- **Subtle and innovative** communication - don't hit users in the face with message
- **Deeper level discovery** - we provide deeper insights than superficial, high-level data others offer
- **Standalone platform** - users don't need to complete basic discovery elsewhere first
- **Don't bash other platforms** - just provide deeper level than most
- **Not claiming revolution** - just bridging the incomplete gap
- **Avoid message duplication**
- **We incorporate foundational features** (except reviews) but go much deeper

### CURRENT SCOPE (Phase 1)
**MOCK-UP LEVEL** - Skip production features like database/authentication

**Homepage Requirements:**
1. **Hero Section** - advertise value/mission, convince visitors they're in right place
2. **Search Box** - for finding software (own section at top)
3. **Top Menu** - "Categories", "Forums", "FAQs", "Contact Us" (link to separate pages)
4. **Problem Section** - list buying process problems we've identified
5. **Solution Section** - our approach to these problems
6. **Deeper Level Messaging** - make clear we provide deeper level insights than superficial, high-level data

**Sample Product Page** (fictional product):
- Product overview (detailed, not rushed)
- **Use cases section** (3-5 key use cases with individual ratings/scores)
- **Use case evaluation** - how well product addresses each use case
- **Use case ratings** - star rating or score per use case (with criteria/context)
- Integrations list (with context - "integrates with X to deliver Y value")
- Pricing section
- Implementation support/Partner page (consultancy companies)
- AI assistant grounded on vendor docs
- Screenshot-based interactive demo experience
- No superficial metrics/numbers

### STRICT GUIDELINES
- **ONLY do what is asked** - no extra features
- **Ask permission** before adding anything extra, even if connected
- **Don't deviate** from instructions
- If unsure about extras, **ASK FIRST**

### TECH STACK CONSIDERATIONS
- Modern web technologies
- Focus on clean, responsive design
- Fast loading times
- Professional appearance

### FUTURE VISION (Reference Only)
- Detailed vendor profiles
- Use cases, features, demos
- Product overviews
- Trends and weaknesses analysis
- Step-by-step purchasing guidance tools

### PROBLEMS WE'RE SOLVING
- **Level 1 platforms leave buyers on their own** after initial research
- **Multiple platform visits required** - time-consuming and effort-intensive
- **Big players overshadow smaller, suitable options** due to money/ranking
- **Free listings treated as 2nd-class citizens**
- **Outdated information** especially on free profiles
- **Superficial insights** - lots of lists, aggregated numbers with little value
- **Lack of depth** - bullet points at glance, missing crucial details
- **Biased/curated reviews**
- **No interactive demos** or outdated videos
- **Low quality leads** from catch-all listings

### OUR SOLUTION APPROACH
- **Unbiased horizontal treatment** of all listings
- **Tools at every step** - research, reports, comparisons, community, implementation
- **Vendor success = our success** - sell the listing, don't distract
- **Focused and niche** - quality over quantity
- **Customized personal profiles** molded to product requirements
- **Detailed profiles** - no rush to impress, take time for depth
- **Use case-based interactive demos** for product feel
- **Regular profile updates** - always current information
- **AI assistant** grounded on up-to-date vendor documentation
- **Context-rich lists** - not just "integrates with X,Y,Z" but "integrates with X to deliver Y value"

### RATING METHODOLOGY - USE CASE FOCUSED
**Unlike G2/Capterra (reviews/comparisons/alternatives/feature ratings):**

**Our Approach: USE CASE-BASED EVALUATION**
- **List common use cases** expected from each product
- **Evaluate how well product addresses each use case**
- **Rate each use case** based on specific criteria
- **Individual use case scores/star ratings** (may or may not average out)
- **Focus on practical application** rather than feature checklists

**Rating Structure:**
- Identify 3-5 key use cases for the product
- Evaluate product performance for each use case
- Assign score/star rating per use case
- Present ratings individually (not necessarily averaged)
- Provide context and reasoning for each rating

---
**Remember: We provide DEEPER LEVEL discovery - going beyond superficial, high-level data that others provide. This is a standalone platform, not a sequential step.**
